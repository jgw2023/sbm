PPT Nuclear energy vs Coal energy PowerPoint, Title: Nuclear energy vs Coal energy 1 Nuclear energy vs Coal energy A Presentation by James Murphy 2 How does nuclear power work? Nuclear power uses the fuel uranium with the isotope of 235 to heat water and drive steam turbin Naturally occurring uranium usually has the isotope of 238 which makes it non fissionable,so Coal Mining: From the Ground to powering Your Home When the coal arrives at the power plant,it is pulverized into a heavy powder that is suitable for burning How is coal used at a power plant? How is electricity Measured?
