sbm starch in mining and drilling processesDensity and Concentration Continuous Measurement in … Several industrial processes require continuous density measurement to operate efficiently and ensure quality and uniformity to the end product.They include sugar and ethanol mills,beer plants,dairy makers,chemical and petrochemical,mining and pulp and paper industries. Starch Starch occurs naturally as a carbohydrate in many plants,where it functions as a glucose store.It is synthesized and stored in granules of varying sizes as an energy source for times of growth,germination,or dormancy.Most cereal grains such as rice,corn,wheat,oats,and barley,as well as tubers such as potatoes and cassava,commonly have very high concentrations of starch. Starch: Perspectives and Opportunities Starch granules are deposited in the seeds,tubers,roots,and stem pith of plants,as a reserve food supply for peri&#173; ods of dormancy,germination,and growth.Starch oc&#173; curs as tiny granules ranging in size from I to 100 mi&#173; crons,the size and shape of the granules being plant spe&#173; cies specific.
