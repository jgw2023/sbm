How Long Does Concrete Take to Cure? Hunker How Long Does Concrete Take to Cure? By Laurie Brenner SAVE; To allow concrete to cure correctly,keep it wet and warm at temperatures between 50 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit for the first week at least Concrete that does not cure properly can shrink,crack or even develop a dusty,weak and crumbly surface The longer you allow concrete to cure. Conventional grade C20,C25 and C30 concrete mix ratio, Different Types of Concrete Strengths and Their Uses Freeze Thaw Durability of Air Entrained Concrete After 200 cycles of freeze thaw,the weight loss was 070,067,and 025 percent for C30,C40,and C50 air entrained concrete,while the weight loss was 235 and 358 percent for C20 and C25 air entrained concrete Vulcraft Roof Catalog REV2 light weight and high strength to weight ratio They provide a durable and attractive roof or floor system for fast all weather construction Steel decks also provide excellent lateral diaphragm action thus reducing the necessity for structural bracing and their incombustible nature assures architects,engineers and owners of excellent fire.
