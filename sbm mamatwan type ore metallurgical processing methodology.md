What are the different types of mining and how do they differ? A rarely used process of mining material,In Situ or solution mining is the process of pumping a solution into the ore body,which dissolves the ore and is then extracted by a second pump This method is used most in mining uranium deposits,with the Beverey Uranium Mine in South Australia being the nations first operating In Situ Uranium Mine Types of Extraction S cool,the revision website Methods of extraction Many metals are found in the Earth's crust as or An ore is usually a compound of the metal mixed with impuriti When the metal is dug up,a method must be used to separate the metal from the rest of the ore This is called extracting the metal The method of extraction depends on how reactive the metal is The more reactive the metal,the more difficult it is to.
