If diluting the nitric and sulfuric acid can precipitate gold too,why would you want to prevent this from happening? Just dissolve the gold,dilute and get it back as pure metal,seems like the perfect solution to rapid gold recovery to me I'm interested in the mang dioxide and sulfuric acid technique too
