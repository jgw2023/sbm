Mineral Resources Tulane University By what processes do ores form? How are mineral resources found and exploited?,From 1880 to about 1960 the grade of copper ore showed a steady decrease from about 3% to less than 1%,mainly due to increased efficiency of mining,gold mines that have ore concentrations well below those found in the US can operate with a profit BHP might have made the biggest copper discovery in recent, Iron oxide copper gold ore deposits (IOCG),like Olympic Dam,can be tremendously large,high grade,and simple to process concentrations of copper,gold and uranium or Olympic Dam which is aiming to produce 215,000 tonnes of copper for FY19 — is the third largest copper equivalent deposit,the largest uranium deposit,and third.
