What are some ways to increase the strength of a concrete, The general rule is that the more cement you have the stronger your concrete,but too much cement also brings with it too much heat generated from hydration which will cause cracks and also retard the reaction The less water you have too the more. Tension Vs Compression of Concrete Hunker Both strengths increase with age,but the ratio is steady Portland cement concrete less than a year old has compression strength of 1,000 pounds per square inch (psi) and tension strength of 200 psi Concrete more than a year old has compression psi of 2,000 pounds and tension psi of 400 Strength of Concrete University of Washington Compressive Strength of Concrete,f’c Concrete Technology 10 Compressive Strength of Concrete,f’c At w c< 03,disproportionately high increase in f’c can be achieved for very small reduction in w c This phenomena is mainly attributed to a significant improvement to the strength of the transition zone (TZ) Reason: The size of the calcium The 28 Day Myth National Precast Concrete Association Oct 28,2013&#0183;&#32;Specified concrete compressive strength is the minimum compressive strength at which the concrete should fail in standard tests of 28 day old concrete cylinders A typical concrete compressive strength specification requires 4,000 to 5,000 psi at 28 days
