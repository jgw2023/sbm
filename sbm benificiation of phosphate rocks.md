Phosphorite Wikipedia Phosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4% [1] to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5 ) How phosphate is mined and processed rock phosphate can become soluble (and available to plants) either by chemical weathering or through the actions of certain types of plants The solubility also depends on rock type and the pH of the soil; phosphorus is most soluble when contained in sedimentary rocks as opposed to igneous rock,and when soil pH is between 55 and 72 124 PHOSPHATE ROCK mineralsusgsgov of the phosphate rock mined was for the manufacture of elemental phosphorus,which was used to
