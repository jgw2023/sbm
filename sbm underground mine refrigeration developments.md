DEVELOPMENT Underground mining and mining machinery Development for underground mining is generally more complex and expensive It requires careful planning and layout of access openings for efﬁcient mining,safety,and permanence The principal openings may be shafts,slopes,or adits; each must be planned to allow passage of workers,machines,ore,waste,air,water,and utiliti Underground Mine Development International Mining The planned underground expansions to existing mines,as well as major new underground operations being looked at,means that achieving faster and more efficient development underground is as much at the fore as it has ever been In this month’s im mining ‘Spotlight Feature Article’,from the pages of the December 2011 issue of International Mining magazine,Editor Paul Moore looks.
