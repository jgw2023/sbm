sbm grinding plant improvementImprovement of Silver Extraction by Ultrafine Grinding … &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Ultrafine grinding (UFG) was proposed as a pretreatment method prior to cyanide leaching of old plant tailings of a refractory silver ore.Direct cyanidation of the as received tailings (d80: 100 &#181;m) led to a low silver extraction of only ≤43% over 24 h.A size based diagnostic study has demonstrated that the refractoriness of the tailings is essentially physical in character.Therefore. Grinding ABB Grinding is a significant and critical part of the ore winning process.On average,milling is the process that requires the most energy in the whole mining operation.To ensure profitable operations,an efficient grinding circuit has to be designed,especially now,where global mineral resources are decreasing and the exploitation of low grade deposits become necessary.
