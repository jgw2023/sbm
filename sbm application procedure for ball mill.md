Ball mill A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics,and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell. High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis The ball mill system consists of one turn disc (turn table) and two or four bowls.The turn disc rotates in one direction while the bowls rotate in the opposite direction.The centrifugal forces,created by the rotation of the bowl around its own axis together with the rotation of the turn disc,are applied to the powder mixture and milling balls in the bowl. Analysis of ball mill grinding operation using mill … &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Kim has presented batch grinding data for 10 14 mesh size fraction of limestone ground in a 25.4 cm ball mill (mill speed,N: 0.5 0.8 (50 80% critical); ball size,d: 25.4 cm; ball load,J: 0.5 (corresponding to 50% filling of mill volume by static ball charge; particle load,U: 1.0 (corresponding to 100% filling of interstitial volume of static ball charge). Ball mill &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The ball mill is used for grinding materials such as coal,pigments,and fedspar for pottery.Grinding can be carried out in either wet or dry but the former is carried out at low speeds.The advantages of wet grinding are less power consumption,increased capacity,no dust formation etc… Ball Mill Application and Design Ball Mill Application and Design.Ball mills are used the size reducing or milling of hard materials such as minerals,glass,advanced ceramics,metal oxides,solar cell and semiconductor materials,nutraceuticals and pharmaceuticals materials down to 1 micron or less.
