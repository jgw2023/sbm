What is the difference between opc and ppc cement? Quora Jul 30,2016&#0183;&#32;Cement is made by heating limestone (calcium carbonate) with small quantities of other materials (such as clay) to 1450&#176;C in a kiln The resulting hard substance,called 'clinker',is then ground with a small amount of gypsum into a powder to make.

Trends and developments in green cement and concrete, Every tonne of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) that is produced releases on average a similar amount of CO 2 into the atmosphere,or in total roughly 6% of all man made carbon emissions Improved production methods and formulations that reduce or eliminate CO 2 emissions from the cement manufacturing process are thus high on the agenda Emission.
