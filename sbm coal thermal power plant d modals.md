Workflow and Performance of Coal Based Thermal Power … Coal is transported from coal mines to the power plant by railway in wagons or if it a pit head station then by merry go round system.Coal is unloaded from wagon to a moving underground conveyor belt.Coal is either stacked in coal stock yard having about 30 days capacity or is taken to coal crusher house with the help of conveyor belt as per CHP layout. Thermal power station Taichung Power Plant,the world's largest coal fired power station,in Taichung,Taiwan A thermal power station is a power station in which heat energy is converted to electricity.Typically,water is heated into steam,which is used to drive an electrical generator. How Does a Coal Power Plant Work? Thermal based power plants can produce electricity from coal or other fuel sources.The coal fired process requires three different steps to turn energy released from burning coal to generating electricity for consumption.Coal fired power plants,while producing power,require a lot of water and produce a lot of pollutants like ash and CO2.Learn how the process works as well as interesting.
