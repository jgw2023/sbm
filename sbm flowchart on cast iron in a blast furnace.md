sbm flowchart on cast iron in a blast furnaceUS4169723A Process of melting blast furnace cast iron, A method and apparatus for the continuous pouring of pig iron from blast furnaces is described The method is based upon the provision of a reservoir external to the furnace and spaced therefrom but connected thereto by a passageway The reservoir of molten metal permits the storage of an amount of molten metal at a level equal to or equilibrated to the level of molten metal within the furnace. 1A Manufacturing Process for Iron and Steel The figure shows a flowchart of the integrated manufacturing process for iron and steel using the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace (denoted BF and BOF hereinafter,respectively),which is presently the most commonly used method (51% of world steel production) Blast furnace Wikipedia Blast furnaces operate on the principle of chemical reduction whereby carbon monoxide converts iron oxides to elemental iron Blast furnaces differ from bloomeries and reverberatory furnaces in that in a blast furnace,flue gas is in direct contact with the ore and iron,allowing carbon monoxide to diffuse into the ore and reduce the iron oxide IRON MAKING IN MINI BLAST FURNACE (MBF) The Blast Furnace ironmaking process had,until recently,been the unchallenged method of making hot metal on a large scale Till 1990,the blast furnace route of ironmaking had about 97% (527mt) share of global iron production Since then many other alternative processes of iron making have arisen eg,Shaft Furnace DR processes (MIDREX,HyL. flowchart on cast iron in a blast furnace flowchart on cast iron in a blast furnace Blast furnace process,Combustion process The iron in the processed ores must be dissolved out by chemical process This requires an element that binds oxygen more strongly than iron This is exactly what carbon can do as a reducing agentThe carbon is fed to the blast furnace,125 Iron And Steel Production,02 to 04 tons of slag,and 25 to 35 tons of.
