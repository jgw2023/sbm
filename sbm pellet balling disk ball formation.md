Disc Pelletizers (Pan Pelletizers) Disc pelletizers utilize a non pressure (tumble growth) approach to agglomeration and work by tumbling material on a rotating disc,with a binding agent and feedstock being continuously added The binding agent causes the fines (or seed pellets,when utilizing a pre conditioning step) to become tacky and pick up additional fines as the material. Water Handbook Filtration SUEZ High rate backwash can cause the formation of mud balls inside the filter bed A high backwash rate and resulting bed expansion can produce random currents in which certain zones of the expanded bed move upward or downward Encrusted solids from the surface can be carried down to form mud balls Efficient surface washing helps prevent this.
