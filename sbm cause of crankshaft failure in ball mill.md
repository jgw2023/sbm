Major causes of bearing failure Normal Appearance Uniform wear pattern over approximately 2 3 of the bearing’s surface Wear should diminish near the parting line ends of the bearing and the wear pattern should extend uniformly across the bearing in the axial direction Ball Mill Zhongde Heavy Industries Co,Ltd These are common problems and solutions when using ball mill Problem 1: When the ball mill is running,there is a very frequent hitting sound and the sound is also very large Solution 1: It should be that some of the lining bolts are not tightly screwed The solution is that you can judge the ball lining by the sound of the machine,then find the loose bolts and tighten them The Selection and Design of Mill Liners MillTraj The profile can be better customised to suit mill speed and filling and therefore optimise performance,and it allows more material in the lifter for a given base width,but the mill must only run in one direction 7 High low double wave ball mill liners
