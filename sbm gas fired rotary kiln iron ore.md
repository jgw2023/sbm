Coal gasification for DRI production An Indian solution using coal fired rotary kilns or natural gas fired shaft furnaces are logical choices as production in blast furnaces is constrained by the need to import coking coal Rotary kiln DRI capacity has been installed because it makes use of domestic iron ore and coal,but there is a limit to the growth of this technology because rotary reduction of manganese ore in rotary kiln REDUCTION OF MANGANESE ORE NML has used both indirect fired and direct fired rotary kilns for reduction of ground manganese ore Coke oven gas was used for both heating and reduction in the indirect fired rotary kiln,as well as in the direct fired rotary kiln (Table I) Chat Now kiln & furnace Muffle Rotary Kiln A muffle rotary kiln is indirect combustion kiln,it applies to high grade iron ore and mill scale,in the condition of reducing atmosphere and high temperature,the iron ore is reduced and volumn shrink,to become high density of DRI ( HDDRI ) Vertical Kilns For Making Iron Ore Pellets In China The midrex process is a shafttype direct reduction process where iron ore pellets lump iron ore or a combination are reduced in a vertical shaft reduction furnace to metallic iron by means of a reduction gas see figure 1139 9,Vertical kilns for making iron ore pellets in china SPONGE IRON PLANT Sponge iron being magnetic gets attracted and gets separated from non magnetic char The iron ore and coal crushed and screened to respective sizes are fed to rotary kiln through feed tube in pre determined ratio The rotary kiln is slightly inclined at an angle 25 deg and rotated by Initial stage of deposit formation process in a coal fired, The serious deposit phenomenon was observed in the coal fired grate rotary kiln plant for iron ore pellet production,which is harmful to the normal production Generally,the formation process of the deposit on the refractory brick can be divided into two stages: the initial stage and growth stage Rotary Kilns Williamson IR For these most common rotary kiln materials,high temperatures in the range of ( 2000&#176;F 1100&#176;C) are used to instigate a chemical conversion (cement and lime) or to fuse fines (fine ore powder) into pellet form (iron ore) Most rotary kilns are direct fired with a flame shooting into the kiln from the discharge end (the fire wall) Rotary Kilns FEECO International Inc Indirect Fired Rotary Kilns Indirect fired kilns are used for various processing applications,such as when processing must occur in an inert environment,when working with finely divided solids,or when the processing environment must be tightly controlled An indirect fired kiln is enclosed in a furnace,which is then externally heated Coal fired rotary kiln anders sehen koennende using coalfired rotary kilns or
