Let us get this straight up front I am going to use the term “curing” in the technical sense,being the definition provided by the ACI Strictly speaking,many concrete elements clearly do not need to be water cured. Curing Concrete Normal,Hot and Cold Weather Concrete can be kept moist and often at a favorable temperature by any of three methods: Maintaining the presence of mixing water during the early hardening period Methods used include ponding or immersion,spraying (or fogging) and wet coverings These methods will also cool the concrete as the water evaporat General Requirements and Sampling IAI Procedure for performing a concrete Air,Slump,& Cylinder Review,eg low air %) In an emergency (concrete waiting to pour) you may elect to allow the technician to use your IAI air pot,but they must still repair their own ASAP and schedule a revisit,Correct concrete mix and note if water reducer is added to the batch (you are.
