material for manufacturing fertilizers and phosphorous chemical products While most of the phosphate resources cannot be directly treated as feed stock due to the low grade of P2O5 and high content of impuriti In order to obtain a qualified phosphate concentrate,the beneficiation of the low grade phosphate ore is,hence,of great necessity Beneficiation Wikipedia History Iron beneficiation has been evident since as early as 800 BC in China with the use of bloomery A bloomery is the original form of smelting and allowed people to make fires hot enough to melt oxides into a liquid that separates
