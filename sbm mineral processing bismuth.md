Bismuth Bi (Element) PubChem Bismuth,which has been known since ancient times,was often confused with lead and tin Bismuth was first shown to be a distinct element in 1753 by Claude Geoffroy the Younger Bismuth does occur free in nature and in such minerals as bismuthinite (Bi 2 S 3) and bismite (Bi 2 O 3) Bismuth resources,reserves and production Metalpedia Bismuth resources,reserves and production; Occurrence in nature; Bismuth,at an estimated 8 parts per billion by weight,ranks 69th in elemental abundance in the Earth’s crust and is about twice as abundant as goldWorld reserves of bismuth are usually based on bismuth content of lead resources because bismuth production is most often a byproduct of processing lead ores; in China,bismuth.
