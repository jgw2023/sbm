Optimization of mill performance by using Optimization of mill performance by using online ball and pulp measurements In the platinum industry,by increasing the solid content in the slurry,the product becomes finer.At a higher percentage solid than 73 to 74%,the product becomes coarser again.At this Ball Milling Method &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Watch this video to learn about Ball Milling MethodTo learn more register at http: learnengg.com What is the ball milling process? &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Wet ball milling is similar to dry ball milling,except that in the grinding process,a certain proportion of water or absolute ethanol is added according to different materials.It is mainly used for materials that do not affect the quality of water,such as gold and copper. Ball mill A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind or blend materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics,and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.
