sbm porosity of quartz sand 0,8 1,4Porosity and Pore Size Distribution USGS aggregate might have a 035 porosity within it,but the medium as a whole has additional pore space in the form of gaps between aggregates,so that φ can be 05 or greater Observed po rosities can be as great as 08 to 09 in a peat (extremely high organic matter) soil Figure 2 Dense packing of polydisperse spher 141 Groundwater and Aquifers Physical Geology 141 Groundwater and Aquifers Groundwater is stored in the open spaces within rocks and within unconsolidated sediments Rocks and sediments near the surface are under less pressure than those at significant depth and therefore tend to have more open space For this reason,and because it’s expensive to drill deep wells,most of the.
