Silica differential in iron ore price slides further as, The reduction in China s domestic production of iron ore,which typically contains high silica,has forced Chinese buyers to seek imports with silica levels that complement their blast furnace blends Features and Uses of Pig Iron Sidhu sody Medium Pig iron is the metallic ore that contains 90% of iron Pig iron is used for making steel and pure iron units It has very high carbon content along with silica and another constituent of dross. Magnetite & Lodestone Mineral Photos,Uses,Properties Most of the iron ore mined today is a banded sedimentary rock known as taconite that contains a mixture of magnetite,hematite,and chert Once considered a waste material,taconite became an important ore after higher grade deposits were depleted Iron and steel Introduction to their science,properties, The high carbon content of cast iron (the same as pig iron—roughly 3 4 percent) makes it extremely hard and brittle: large crystals of carbon embedded in cast iron stop the crystals of iron from moving about Investors in Australia Look Set for a Dividend Bonanza, Jul 29,2018&#0183;&#32;Watch video&#0183;&#32;Still,not all iron ore stocks are so positive While BHP and Rio are seen lifting payouts,Fortescue Metals Group Ltd is expected to cut its dividend by more than a quarter amid a global.
