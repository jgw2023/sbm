Copper Ore Beneficiation Technology Copper Ore Beneficiation Technology In modern industry and daily life,copper has a wide range of application and demand It has an important and irreplaceable position in electric,marine,aviation,communication,petrochemicals,household appliances,high energy physics,metallurgy,etc Swimming downstream: Zambia’s potential for copper, Nevertheless,the introduction of a copper concentrate runs contrary to Zambia’s stated development plans of encouraging ‘value addition’ and economic diversification Here’s why What is beneficiation? Think of beneficiation as selling banana ice cream instead of plucked bananas straight from the tree Beneficiation of Iron Ore Mineral Processing & Metallurgy Beneficiation of Iron Ore and the treatment of magnetic iron taconites,stage grinding and wet magnetic separation is standard practiceThis also applies to iron ores of the non magnetic type which after a reducing roast are amenable to magnetic separation All such plants are large tonnage operations treating up to 50,000 tons per day and ultimately requiring grinding as fine as minus 500.
