What's a Rock Crusher? Cone crusher with the working principle of the same cycle crusher,but only if broken or minor operations in the broken machinery.Minor operations nesting uniformity of the size of the general operating requirements than the rough broken high Therefore,in the crushing chamber should be provided for a section of the lower part of the parallel,at the same time,but also speed up the cycle. Cone Crushers McLanahan Cone Crusher Applications A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio.A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio.Thus,with a 3⁄4” closed side setting,the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5 inches. What affects cone crusher performance? — Sandvik Mining … Any fluctuation in pressure means that the optimal force will not be delivered consistently so,of course,crusher performance declines.These are the two main causes of sub optimal crushing performance,but losses in the reduction ratio can also be caused by selecting the wrong mantle or by having a poor chamber profile or design.
