What is the cement particle size? Quora Cement is a dispersed solid whose particle size is ranging from 01 to 250 micron meter *For example,if the particle size of a material is described as 4 +40 mesh,then 90% or more of the material will pass through a 4 mesh sieve (particles smaller than 476 mm) and be retained by a 40 mesh sieve (particles larger than 0420 mm) Portland cement Wikipedia Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and non specialty grout,The grinding process is controlled to obtain a powder with a broad particle size range. Cement Measuring the Particle Size Distribution of, Measuring and controlling the particle size distribution of cement is important both in order to achieve the desired product performance and to control manufacturing costs,Measuring the Particle Size Distribution of Cement Using Laser Diffraction by Horiba Scientific,please refer to Particle Size Analysis of Cement Applications.
