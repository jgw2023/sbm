The Pros and Cons of Manufactured Sand Presence of silt and clay in natural sand: Natural sand is inherently high in silt and clay.It can be damaging for screed and concrete,if the sand is not sufficiently processed to bring down clay and other impurity content to acceptable levels. SECTION M05 (b) Plasticity: When screenings or any combination of screenings and natural sand or any combination of stone sand and natural sand are used,the following requirements shall apply: (1) When the fraction of the dry sample passing the No.100 (150 &#181;m) mesh sieve is 6% or less by weight (mass),no plastic limit test will be made. Sand Sand is a granular material composed of finely divided rock and mineral particles.It is defined by size,being finer than gravel and coarser than silt.Sand can also refer to a textural class of soil or soil type; i.e.a soil containing more than 85 percent sand sized particles by mass.

Hanson Building Sand Technical Data Sheet Hanson Building Sand Technical Data Sheet DESCRIPTION A washed sand conforming to BS EN 13139:2013 Aggregates for mortar.The typical moisture content is 7.5%.USES Production of mortar,for the construction of masonry brick and block work. Sand Equivalent Therefore,the MB value is proportional to the product of the clay content times the specific surface of the clay (Hosking,1992 [5]).Higher MB values indicate more clay.Based on their test results,Kandhal,Lynn and Parker (1998 [2] ) recommended the MB test over the sand equivalent test as the one that is “best related to stripping in HMA”.
