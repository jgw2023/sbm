Curved And Inclined Construction Lift Thus,our company,allying with Institute of Building Mechanization China Academy of Building Research,exploited the first curved construction lift in China.1 for odd shaped exterior building 2 for chimney and cooling tower 3 patented product Model tests on vacuum preloading technology of super soft. The reclaimed land is formed by use of the super soft soil with water content of 80%.With the development of land reclamation,the thickness of the reclaimed soil becomes thicker and thicker,so that great deformation occurs during the vacuum preloading.The vane test strength reaches about 40 kPa in the surface of the foundation after vacuum preloading in the field,but below the depth of 3 4 m.

Stability of embankment on soft subgrade reinforced by. The stability analysis of embankments reinforced by a single pile carried out by the authors shows that the limit equilibrium method can not consider the failure mechanism of the single pile at different locations and thus will overestimate the embankment stability when the composite shear strength is used.3D and 2D numerical analyses are performed to study the stability of embankment.
