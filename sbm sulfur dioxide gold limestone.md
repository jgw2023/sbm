What happens when acid reacts with limestone? Questions, Jun 15,2008&#0183;&#32;Limestone is mostly made up of the mineral calcium carbonate (CaCO3) This is not very soluble,so rocks don't dissolve very quickly But if you add an acid,you add hydrogen ions (H+),which will react with the carbonate to form hydrogen carbonate HCO3 ions,which are very soluble in water,and the limestone will dissolve Or,if there is more acid,two hydrogen ions will Wet Limestone Scrubbing Fundamentals Power Engineering Simply stated,an alkaline limestone slurry reacts with acidic sulfur dioxide As flue gas passes through the scrubber and is contacted by the limestone slurry sprays,sulfur dioxide absorbs into.
