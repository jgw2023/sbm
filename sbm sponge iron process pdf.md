(with pictures) Nov 18,2019&#0183;&#32;Sometimes known as direct reduced iron,sponge iron is a product that is produced using iron ore The iron ore is often in the form of pellets or lumps,and is subjected to a reduction process that is created by the use of a reducing gas that emits from coal or a natural gas source Rotary Kiln Sponge Iron Plant Pdf FTMLIE Heavy Machinery Rotary Kiln Sponge Iron Plant Pdf In sponge iron industry rotary kiln is the primary equipment which is used to reduce iron ore to metallic iron ie Fe which is called sponge iron The performance of rotary kiln significantly affects the production capacities of these industries The performance of rotary kiln is Sponge Iron Production By Direct Reduction Of Iron Oxide, This book provides a fascinating study of the very important emerging field of direct reduction in which iron ore is ‘directly reduced’ in the solid state,using either natural gas or non coking coal,to produce a highly metallised material,referred to as sponge iron (or direct reduced iron) This intermediate product is subsequently melted in electric arc furnaces or induction furnaces. No 117 HBI Hot Briquetting of Direct Reduced Iron, (IMO) confirm that Hot Briquetted Iron (HBI) can be handled and shipped without special precautions From the mid 1970s until today,after extensive pilot testing of the technology,a number of industrial plants for the hot briquetting of direct reduced iron went into operation Ad Energy Audit Methodology of Sponge Iron Manufacturing, Conducting complete energy audit (both process and utility) of a sponge iron unit is challenging as there is no laid down procedure to audit the process side Further,the average heat to power ratio (kW th kW e ) of sponge iron plants ranges from (25:1) to (31:1) This shows that the manufacturing process mostly uses thermal energy and application of electrical energy is insignificant
