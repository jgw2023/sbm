sbm uniaxial compressive test on rockThe uniaxial compressive strength of soft rock Free, The term soft rock is often referred to rock materials with a uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) lower than that of hard rocks and higher than that of soils A rock material can be classified as a soft rock if it has a uniaxial compressive strength below 20 MPa,determined directly by uniaxial compression, Compressive strength of rocks PetroWiki Estimating compressive strength General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0) Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis,so m may be estimated (Table 1) What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0 Estimating thestrength ofrock materials SAIMM property testing of rock material have emerged Table II provides some information compiled during thisresearch This survey has shown that the mining engineer requires mainly two rock material properties,namely,the uniaxial compressive strengthandthe triaxial strength of rock Toobtain this information,the design en gineer isprepared. Point Load Test The Point Load Test,also known as the Point Load Strength Index Test,is used to calculate the rock strength index of a rock specimen From the rock strength index,other rock parameters,such as the uniaxial compressive strength,can be estimatedThis test is very economical due to the simplicity of the apparatus and the minimal amount of required materials to execute uniaxial compressive strength Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary A measure of a material’s strength The uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) is the maximum axial compressive stress that a right cylindrical sample of material can withstand before failing It is also known as the unconfined compressive strength of a material because confining stress is set to zero (PDF) The Uniaxial Compressive Strength of Soft Rock Soft rock is a term that usually refers to a rock material with a uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) less than 20 MPa This low strength range might be influenced by physical characteristics.
