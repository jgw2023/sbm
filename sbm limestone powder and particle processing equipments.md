How to Make Limestone Powder for Power Plant, Aug 12,2021&#0183;&#32;At first,the typical specification of limestone particle size is that the limestone powder can pass through a 200 mesh sieve,and the pass rate is 70% However,FGD system designers and chemists are beginning to realize that this kind of limestone powder is too coarse,which will result in low limestone utilization and low desulfurization. Optimizing the Mixing of Powders, Chemical Processing equipment fall into the mixing vessel,contaminating the production process and damaging valuable factory equipment Finally,throughout the mixing process,powder will stick to the vessel walls and other internal vessel parts This is quite normal,but leads to the build up of lumps and agglomerates when the powder comes in contact with the.
