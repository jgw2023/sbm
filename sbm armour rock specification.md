Breakwater (structure) Wikipedia A breakwater structure is designed to absorb the energy of the waves that hit it,either by using mass (eg,with caissons),or by using a revetment slope (eg,with rock or concrete armour units) In coastal engineering,a revetment is a land backed structure whilst a breakwater is a sea backed structure (ie,water on both sides) Standard Test Method For Specific Gravity And, 51 Rock riprap and armor stone are composed of pieces of natural rock that are placed on construction projects,shorelines,streambeds,bridge abutments,pilings,and other structures to minimize the effects of erosion The ability of rock to withstand deterioration from weathering affects both.
