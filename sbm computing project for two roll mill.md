What are main Types of Rolling mill? This mill consist two rollers arranged as shown in figure.Both the rollers rotate in opposite direction for desire movement of work piece.Work piece is feed between the rollers which apply a compressive force and tends to plastically deform work piece and convert it into desire shape. Rolling Mill A four roll configuration is known as a 4 High Rolling Mill,whereby the work rolls are generally smaller in diameter supported by larger backup rollers.These mill can be used for tighter tolerance output material,and for reducing material to extremely small thicknesses. Basics of Rolling and Rolling Mills IspatGuru Two high mill roll configuration This is the most commonly used rolling mill configuration.In this configuration,there are two horizontally mounted rolls.The rolling mill motor drives either both rolls (top and bottom) or only one roll (normally the bottom roll) with the top roll rotating due to the friction between the roll and the work piece. Roller mill Roller mills are mills that use cylindrical rollers,either in opposing pairs or against flat plates,to crush or grind various materials,such as grain,ore,gravel,plastic,and others.Roller grain mills are an alternative to traditional millstone arrangements in gristmills.Roller mills for rock complement other types of mills,such as.
