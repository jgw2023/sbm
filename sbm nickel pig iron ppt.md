sbm nickel pig iron pptNickel pig iron Wikipedia Nickel pig iron (NPI) is a low grade ferronickel invented in China as a cheaper alternative to pure nickel for the production of stainless steel The production process of nickel pig iron utilizes laterite nickel ores instead of pure nickel sold on the world market The alternative was developed as a response to high price of pure nickel Definition: Nickel,Ferronickel,Nickel Pig Iron,Nickel, 24 07 2020&#0183;&#32;The nickel content of nickel pig iron is less than 15% Generally,according to the nickel content of nickel pig iron,it can be divided into high grade nickel pig iron (10% and above),medium grade nickel pig iron (4 9%),and low grade nickel pig iron Nickel pig iron is smelted mainly in submerged arc furnaces and blast furnac Chinese Nickel Pig Iron Study Shanghai Metals Market To have a deep understanding of Chinese nickel pig iron market Capacity,costs and growth potential of RKEF,EAF and BF production technologi Quality,origin,pricing and contract terms of Nickel ore feed,Summary of China Nickel Pig Iron Study (PPT) Spreadsheet of China NPI Supply & Cost Database (EXCEL) Spreadsheet of China NPI.
