Method of producing calcium bromide The present invention is an improved method for producing calcium bromide by reacting hydrogen bromide with calcium hydroxide in the presence of water and carbonate ions.The improved process comprises maintaining a sufficient pH in the reaction mixture to convert at least a portion of the carbonate ions to a gaseous carbon oxygen compound thereby removing the carbonate ions from the reaction.
