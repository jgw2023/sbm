US Patent for Gold recovery from refractory carbonaceous, 22 A process for recovering gold from a refractory sulfidic and refractory carbonaceous auriferous ore having preg robbing characteristics due to the presence of organic carbon comprising the steps of:,subjecting the ore slurry to pressure oxidation in an autoclave to produce a gold, METHOD TO IMPROVE RECOVERY OF GOLD FROM DOUBLE, Mar 19,2009&#0183;&#32;A new gold bearing sulfide ore (BR31 new) is ground to P 80 less than 70 microns The POX CIL recovery was similar to that shown in Table 3 The POX discharge was treated using a two stage flotation process consisting of rougher and cleaner flotation circuits,wherein a portion of the preg robbing TCM is concentrated,as shown in FIGS 1A and 1B Treatment of Refractory Gold Ores XPS Treatment of Refractory Gold Ores Extractive Metallurgy Once the cause has been identified,there are a number of alternatives for treating the ore Firstly,the gold can be made more amenable to cyanidation by ultra fine milling,followed by a hot atmospheric leach the Albion Process Gold PM Conference ALTA Metallurgical Services Gold PM Conference Sponsored by 7 th Annual Gold Event,speci cally for pressurized autoclave equipmentﬁ,THE USE OF SPECIAL ADDITIVES TO INHIBIT PREG ROBBING OF GOLD IN THE PROCESS OF DOUBLE REFRACTORY CONCENTRATES PRESSURE OXIDATION 231 Ilia V Fomenko,M A Pleshkov,P V Zaytsev,L V Chugaev,Y M Shneerson,SRC. Barrick Thiosulfate Leaching of Double Refractory Ore recover gold from double refractory ores instead of single refractory ores,gold has a strong affinity for the carbon in the ore slurry along with the activated carbon used to capture the gold in solution and thus,can be lost through the tails This phenomena is called preg robbing Minerals Free Full Text CIL Gold Loss Characterization, A double refractory gold ore contains gold particles locked in sulphides,solid solution in arsenopyrite,and preg robbing material such as carbonaceous matter,and so on The diagnostic leach test (DLT) and preg robbing (PR) approaches are widely used to investigate the occurrence and the distribution of refractory gold DLT serves to qualitatively evaluate the gold occurrences within the ore CIL Gold Loss Characterization within Oxidized Leach Tails, characterization,diagnostic leach tests,and preg robbing tests 2 Material and Methods Mineralogical characterization,DLT,and adsorption tests were performed to study the gold distribution and preg robbing,using four samples taken from the mill carbon in leach (CIL) tailings at the Kittilä Mine in Finland (oxidized tailings) CIP and CIL Mining and Minerals Industries Lightnin, Carbon in leach (CIL) is a simultaneous leach and absorption process The simultaneous leach and absorption phases of the CIL process were developed for processing gold ores that contain preg robbing materials such as natural absorptive carbon These reduce the gold yield by attracting gold meant for the activated carbon PRESSURE OXIDATION OF REFRACTORY GOLD ORES: THE, Pressure Oxidation Pressure oxidation is employed to liberate gold and silver in refractory sulfide concentrates often and or The main pressure oxidation products from iron sulfide minerals are sulfuric acid (and metal sulfates) and hematite Depending on the conditions within the autoclave,acid containing iron compounds can be formed US5536297A Gold recovery from refractory carbonaceous, A process for recovering gold in which an ore slurry of refractory sulfidic and refractory carbonaceous ore having preg robbing characteristics due to the presence of organic carbon is subjected to pressure oxidation in an autoclave The oxidized ore slurry is mixed with a thiosulfate salt lixiviant,which mixture is maintained at a pH between 7 and 87 while the slurry is agitated in a.
