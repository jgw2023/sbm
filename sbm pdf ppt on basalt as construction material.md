the design life of the embankment These long term effects shall be considered when selecting properties to use for design 5 4 Methods of Determining Soil and Rock Properti Subsurface soil or rock properties are generally determined using one or more of the Specific Gravity Of General Materials Table The specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density,no matter how small or large the fraction is For example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 073 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 113 (1130 kilograms cubic
