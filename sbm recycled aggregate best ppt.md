Recycled Aggregate Concrete Nov 15,2014&#0183;&#32;It is called recycled aggregate which can be produced by concrete crusher The aggregates are categorized by size as coarse and fine aggregate The characteristic of recycled aggregates could be different by its parent concrete because the parent concrete was designed for its purposes such as permeable,durable and high strength concrete recycled aggregate best ppt laerchenrainit Crushed concrete aggregates also called as recycled concrete aggregates are fragments and pieces of concrete buildings which are demolished or rebuild These crushed concrete are cleaned from dirt and broken to smaller pieces to manufacture aggregate which is termed as recycled aggregate,The PowerPoint PPT presentation: "Aggregates in. Crushed Concrete Aggregates Properties and Uses of, Shear strength of recycled aggregate concrete is lesser than of normal concrete This is because the recycled aggregate from field demolished concrete for example can be relatively weaker than a typical natural aggregate In general,there is a 10% decrease in strength when recycled coarse aggregates are used Uses of Crushed Concrete Aggregates PROPERTIES OF RECYCLED AGGREGATE CONCRETE Mirjana Malešev,et al,Properties of recycled aggregate concrete Contemporary Materials,V −2 (2014) Page 242 of 249 24 Bulk density of aggregate The bulk density of the recycled aggregate,due to a higher porosity of mortar layer,has a lower value than the bulk density of natural aggregates and.
