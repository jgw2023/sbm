Take up Options for Belt Conveyors FEECO International Inc Telescoping screw take up on a FEECO Belt Feeder Gravity Take up (GTU) Screw take ups are generally not suited to accommodate the length of belt stretch that occurs in conveyors longer than 150’ and in these settings,the gravity take up is usually the best approach to belt tensioning conveyor gravity take up specifications Conveyor Gravity Take Up Specifications Antwerpse Conveyor Gravity Take Up Specifications We are a large scale manufacturer specializing in producing various mining machines including different types of sand and gravel equipment,milling equipment,mineral processing equipment and building materials equipment Conveyor Tension and Take Up Systems 7 CONVEYOR TAKE UP DEVICES In searching for Conveyor Take Up Actuation,there are a variety of devices to choose from: a) Gravity Tower Counterweight b) Hydraulic c) Screw jack d) Manual Winch e) Air Winches f) Electric Winch g) Constant Tension Winches a Magnetic Slip Clutch gravity take up weight for inclined conveyor belt Conveyor Gravity Take up Calculator Conveyor,Belt,30" X 250',Inclined,30 Kw,Gravity Take Up Automation of Material Handling with Bucket Elevator,Index Term Belt Conveyor,Bucket Elevator,Weight sensor,and only the force of gravity Conveyor Belt Equations The required take up length is calculated as follows,where S Sp = take up length (m) L = conveyor length (m) ε = belt elongation,elastic and permanent (%) As a rough guideline,use 1,5 % elongation for textile belts and 0,2 % for steel cord belts Note: For long, Conveyor Gravity Take Up Specifications 2 gravity take up 3 winch take up fixed belt length during operation 4 active winch take up variable belt length during conveyor running screw take up is the cheapest but would not be practical for take up travel more than about 1200mm 48 inchSo,for take up travel more than this value,the remaining three options are available Take up Winches Gravity take up winch normally operates to lift up the counterweight to relief the belt tension for maintenance or lower counterweight down for maintenance Winch is located close to the take up tower The rope is either connected to the counterweight or conveyor trolley, ON BELT CONVEYOR SCALE SYSTEMS gravity type take ups,spring tension,and pneumatic hydraulic controlled tension Currently,the NIST Handbook 44,Specifications,Tolerances,and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices,Belt Conveyor Scale Systems Code only permits the “counter What is the vertical gravity take up of a belt conveyor, Answer: Conveyor The conditions of operation of a conveyor belt vary continuously with start up,with running with varying load and stopping It is crucial that the Take Up Tension on a Conveyor Belt is adequate for all the varying conditions The minimum required tension is directly proportion.
