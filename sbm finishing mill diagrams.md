Climb Milling versus Conventional Milling [ Sneaky CNC, Climb Milling = Down Milling Conventional Milling = Up Miling Climb milling is when the direction of cut and rotation of the cutter combine to try to “suck” the mill up over (hence it’s called “climb” milling) or away from the work It produces the best surface finish Here is a diagram showing climb versus conventional milling for. POLYMER80 The goal of finishing the lower receiver is to mill out the fire control pocket of the receiver to the proper depth,and to utilize the jig to achieve correct placement on the side holes (trigger,hammer and safety holes) The solid core fills the entire fire control pocket Hammer mills : an engineering overview What is it ?
