Glossary US Energy Information Administration (EIA) Capacity utilization: Capacity utilization is computed by dividing production by productive capacity and multiplying by 100 Captive coal: Coal produced to satisfy the needs of the mine owner,or of a parent,subsidiary,or other affiliate of the mine owner (for example,steel companies and electricity generators),rather than for open market sale SCREEN CAPACITY CALCULATION VIBFEM Current screen capacity calculations do not take into consideration enough of the factors affecting screen efficiency The old formulas were designed to keep calculations short and manageable for manual calculation The common use of computers in today’s world makes it possible to do more complex screen capacity calculations in much shorter time Sieve Bends Multotec Optimising your separation efficiency The sieve bend (or DSM screen) is an important and effective solution in size classification and dewatering fine particle slurries in heavy minerals processing applicationsSieve bends do not require power to operate (unless a tilting system is integrated),and are a low cost,quiet and efficient part of your screening process Carbon Dioxide Emission Factors for Coal The typical carbon content for coal (dry basis) ranges from more than 60 percent for lignite to more than 80 percent for anthracite Although hydrogen generates about 62,000 Btu per pound,it accounts for only 5 percent or less of coal and not all of this is available for heat because part of the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water. Principles of Screening and Sizing Basic capacity figure is expressed as tph per sqft • Figure is multiplied by the sq footage of the screen deck • Calculation gives the basic capacity of each deck and the total capacity of the vibrating screen • The vibrating screen capacity is determined: • Using a standard sizing formula (9 variables) • Basic capacity of.
