GISERA Schematic diagram of coal seam gas extraction process Why use natural gas as an energy source? Natural gas extracted from coal seams can offer a number of benefits as an energy source: natural gas typically burns more efficiently than coal or oil and can emit less greenhouse gas at the points of extraction and combustion Coal Seam Gas (CSG) Santos Coal seam gas (CSG) is natural gas mainly composed of methane,the odourless and colourless gas used in homes and business Natural gas from coal seams is used in exactly the same way as other natural gas,for cooking,heating,electricity production and to make products such as fertilisers CBM well drilling and completion PetroWiki The process of drilling and completing coalbed methane (CBM) wells is similar to wells in conventional reservoirs,Natural cavitation begins by drilling a targeted coal seam with air,gas,or mist The bit is then lifted above the seam and the well is shut in,resulting in the flow of water,gas,and coal rubble to the surface while. The coal seam gas debate Parliament of Australia CSG,however,is found in coal seams,where underground water pressure keeps it contained Pumping water out of the coal seam releases this pressure and allows gas to escape from the coal into a well Well spacing: in conventional gas reservoirs,a single well can give a good flow rate,as the gas steadily migrates towards the well and then out Step By Step Diagram Of Coal Mining greenrevolutionorgin step by step diagram of coal mining Expert Scientific Committee on Coal Seam Gas and Coal Mining through Schematic diagram of the bioregional assessment methodology,when followed step by step,due to the differences in data,geology,hydrogeology and ecology An Overview of the Coal Seam Gas Process proven recoverable seam gas,Exploration is underway in Victoria and is Considered to be prospective in WA diagram not to scale illustrative purposes only Silts clays Aquifers 100 200m below surface Unfracked well Coal seam permeable enough to allow sufficient gas flow Gas Coal seam gas Wells typically take 2 weeks to drill
