Asteroids and ore EVE University Wiki In general,the rarer the ore,the higher its volume per unit (eg one unit of Veldspar has a volume of 01 m 3,whereas one unit of Arkonor has a volume of 16 m 3) Since mining lasers mine a given volume of ore per minute,it takes longer to mine the rarer ore typ Additionally,each ore reprocesses into a different set of minerals Google Search the world's information,including webpages,images,videos and more Google has many special features to help you find exactly what you're looking for Mining Vendetta Wiki The mining xp you get for mining the ores is negligable but considering the amount of mining that can be done with multiple beams concentrated on a roid roids over a period of time,it is fairly easy to get the lower level licens I've also found that the mining missions are a great way to build faction standing with a particular faction Alysii's PI Scheme All artwork,screenshots,characters,vehicles,storylines,world facts or other recognizable features of the intellectual property relating to these trademarks are likewise the intellectual property of CCP hf CCP hf has granted permission to [insert your name or site name] to use EVE Online and all associated logos and designs for.
