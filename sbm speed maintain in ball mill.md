How ball mill works? The ball mill is a hollow drum closed with loading and unloading end caps,filled with grinding media and rotated around its axis.The drum of the ball mill (Pic.1) is a hollow cylinder of steel,lined inside with armor lining plates which protect it from impact and friction. The ball load and critical speed of the roll mill has … &nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The ball of ourtermost shell in the roll mill does not dropping along the barrel rotating together,the rotate speed of the roll mill call critical speed.The critical speed of all kinds of roll mills are proportional to its diameter,the critical speed,is is difficult to work out absolute figure,at present there is but the computaional formula of the theory critical speed is widespread. Cement mill Ball mills are normally operated at around 75% of critical speed,so a mill with diameter 5 metres will turn at around 14 rpm.The mill is usually divided into at least two chambers (although this depends upon feed input size mills including a roller press are mostly single chambered),allowing the use of different sizes of grinding media. Why Critical Speed Maintain In Ball Mill Critical speed refers to the speed at which the enclosed balls begin to rotate along the inner walls of the ball mill.If a ball mill fails to reach critical speed,the balls will remain stationary at the bottom where they have little or no impact on the material.Get Support.
