OPC Cement,53 Grade Cement Hi Bond Cement,OPC, 53 Grade OPC Cement 53 Grade OPC is a higher strength cement to meet the needs of the consumer for higher strength concrete As per BIS requirements the minimum 28 days compressive strength of 53 Grade OPC should not be less than 53 MPa Mix Design for Pumped Concrete with PPC,OPC,OPC+Flyash Mix Design for Pumped Concrete with PPC,OPC,OPC+Flyash A simple method of concrete mix design for pumpable concrete based on an estimated weight of the concrete per unit volume is presented in the article The Tables and Figures included are worked out by the author from a wide range of materials available in the country Alternative Binders for Concrete Other Than Cement Alternative Binders for Concrete other than Cement,A triple blend binder design (OPC Gypsum PFA) has a lower 7 dayy stren gth than a OPC Gypsum mix design but the 28 day strengths of both designs are similar. design of opc concrete colin budpl 28 06 2020&#0183;&#32;Strength of Concrete vs Grades of Cement At present when manufacturers of PPC are not grading their product and also the supply of OPC in open market is highly restricted,the consumer is left with the only option to find out ways to use available cements for design of concrete mixes for various applications Slag in the mix design Concrete Engineering general, Aug 16,2007&#0183;&#32;The link below is to a report published by the concrete society,you may be able to get a copy from a library As patswfc it is often used (along with pfa) as a method of reducing the overall temperatures generated during hydration as it replaces the OPC, Concrete Mix Design M 20 Grade Of Concrete APPENDIX 1 OPC CONCRETE MIXTURE PROPORTIONING Mix Design for OPC Concrete Data Compressive strength at 28 days = 30 N mm 2 Maximum size of coarse aggregate = 20 mm Shape of coarse aggregate = Angular Degree of workability = Medium Degree of quality control = Good Type of exposure = Moderate
