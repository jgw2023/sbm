The Art and Science of Refining Gold at Home Feb 12,2016&#0183;&#32;The Art and Science of Refining Gold at Home A quick tutorial in DIY chemistry By Eric Limer Feb 12,2016 You'd be forgiven for thinking that things like the process of refining gold are. How gold is made history,used,parts,procedure, Gold,recognizable by its yellowish cast,is one of the oldest metals used by humans As far back as the Neolithic period,humans have collected gold from stream beds,and the actual mining of gold can be traced as far back as 3500 BC,when early Egyptians (the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia) used mined gold to craft elaborate jewelry,religious artifacts,and utensils such as goblets
