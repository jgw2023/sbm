Answers A hopper car is a railroad car used to carry loose materials like coal or grain I know of nothing on an automobile called a hopper,Liquids don't have a defined shape but does have mass. Why do metals have grain? I thought metal has a uniform, Metals have grains where the boundaries of two crystals growing in different directions meet When cooling a liquid metal,it does not solidify everywhere at once,nor does the solidification start in just one place and spread outward from there. Classification of Sedimentary Rocks The names in the above chart are root names and should be preceded by appropriate terms for any significant feature of the rock The proper order is color,structure,grain size (sandstones only),minor constituents,cement,and root name Why Are Grain Silos Round? Bizfluent Some silos do incorporate mechanized weighing structures and an elevator to load trucks or freight cars,but in most cases that is unnecessary Without mechanization,the weight of the truck is known before it is filled and then weighed afterward Those two numbers let you determine how many tons (or bushels) of grain have been loaded for market Sedimentary Rocks Diatomite When diatoms accumulate and do not undergo recrystallization,they form a white rock called diatomite as seen in the White Cliffs of Dover (see figure 722b in your text) Coal Coal is an organic rock made from organic carbon that is the remains of fossil plant matter It accumulates in lush tropical wetland settings and requires.
