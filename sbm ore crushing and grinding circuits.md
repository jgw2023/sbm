OverGrinding in grinding circuits Simulations of a magnetite ore grinding circuit indicated that a reconfiguration of the circuit could greatly reduce the overgrinding problem.The use of two stage hydrocycloning can concentrate the near size high density magnetite particles into a closely sized single stream that requires only a very small amount of grinding to reach the target size. Grinding Circuit A flow sheet of a typical iron ore crushing and grinding circuit is shown in Figure 1.2.2 (based on Ref.[4]).This type of flow sheet is usually followed when the crude ore contains below 30% iron.The number of steps involved in crushing and grinding depends on various factors such as the hardness of the ore and the level of impurities present [ 5 ].
