Yahoo Answers Nov 26,2009&#0183;&#32;Electric Motor types for a conveyor system?,Best Answer: An existing system installed more than ten years ago might use DC motors because DC motors were most often used when speed control or slow acceleration was required Today,3 phase AC motors are used for most applications for both fixed speed and variable speed motors. DC motors: Why are they still used? Plant Services A DC motor can develop full torque within the operational speed range from zero to base speed (Figure 1) This allows the DC motor to be used on constant torque loads such as conveyor belts,elevators,cranes,ski lifts,extruders and mixers How does a speed control motor work in a conveyor belt, Mostly DC shunt motor is preferred for Conveyer where as single phase AC motor can beused because of availability For both control method can be used In case of DC controlled rectifiers and for AC TRIAC based regulators can be used Brushed DC electric motor Wikipedia Brushed DC electric motor A brushed DC motor is an internally commutated electric motor designed to be run from a direct current power source Brushed motors were the first commercially important application of electric power to driving mechanical energy,and DC distribution systems were used for more than 100 years to operate motors in. DC motor advantages in industrial applications, The DC motor is still the best solution for many industrial applications,particularly those requiring constant torque across the motor’s entire speed range,such as conveyor belts,elevators,cranes,ski lifts,extruders and mixers,DC drives need only to rectify AC power before passing it to the DC motor DC motors can be directly.
